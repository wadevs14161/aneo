# Stripe Database Integration Status & Action Plan

## ✅ Current Status

### Tables Exist ✅
All required Stripe tables are properly created in Supabase:
- `stripe_customers` (0 records) ✅
- `stripe_payment_methods` (0 records) ✅  
- `stripe_webhooks_log` (0 records) ✅
- `orders` (0 records) ✅
- `purchases` (0 records) ✅

### Code Structure ✅
- ✅ Created `/src/lib/actions/stripe-actions.ts` - Dedicated Stripe database actions
- ✅ Updated `/src/lib/actions/order-actions.ts` - Uses new Stripe actions
- ✅ Updated `/src/pages/api/stripe/webhook.ts` - Uses new webhook handlers

### Environment Variables ✅
- ✅ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Present
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Present  
- ✅ `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Present
- ✅ Supabase connection - Working

## ❌ Root Cause of Missing Records

### Issue 1: UUID Format Validation
The database expects proper UUID format for `user_id` fields:
```
❌ invalid input syntax for type uuid: "test-user-1757964708802"
✅ Expected: "779bc442-fe89-41bb-b5a7-4bff6b5b4630"
```

### Issue 2: Missing Service Role Key
Webhook processing likely needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for database writes:
```bash
# Missing from .env.local:
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

### Issue 3: Error Handling Swallows Issues
Current code logs errors but continues processing, so failures aren't visible.

## 🔧 Action Plan

### Step 1: Add Service Role Key
Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
# Get this from Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### Step 2: Improve Error Logging
Enhanced logging in payment processing to surface database errors:
- ✅ Added detailed console logs with emojis
- ✅ Added try/catch blocks with proper error propagation
- ✅ Made errors visible during development

### Step 3: Test Real Payment Flow
Since tables exist and code is correct, test the actual payment:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Add items to cart
3. Process payment
4. Check console logs for database operations
5. Verify records in Supabase dashboard

### Step 4: Webhook Testing
For webhook events to be processed:
1. Use Stripe CLI: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook`
2. Process a test payment
3. Watch for webhook events in console

## 🧪 Testing Commands

### Test Database Connection
```bash
node test-stripe-db.js
# ✅ Confirmed tables exist
```

### Test Payment Processing
```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. In another terminal, watch logs
tail -f .next/app-build-manifests.json # or watch browser console

# 3. Process a payment and look for:
# 🔄 Creating/getting Stripe customer for user: 779bc442...
# ✅ Stripe customer ready: cus_...
# 💾 Stripe customer saved to database: ...
```

## 🎯 Expected Results After Fix

### Database Records
After successful payment, you should see:
```sql
-- stripe_customers table
SELECT * FROM stripe_customers;
-- Should show: user_id, stripe_customer_id, email, etc.

-- stripe_webhooks_log table  
SELECT * FROM stripe_webhooks_log;
-- Should show: event_type, processed, data, etc.

-- orders table
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE stripe_payment_intent_id IS NOT NULL;
-- Should show: orders with Stripe payment intent IDs
```

### Console Logs
```
🔄 Creating/getting Stripe customer for user: 779bc442-fe89-41bb-b5a7-4bff6b5b4630
✅ Stripe customer ready: cus_test_123
💾 Stripe customer saved to database: 1
💳 Creating Stripe PaymentIntent...
✅ PaymentIntent created: pi_test_456
🔄 Confirming PaymentIntent...
✅ PaymentIntent confirmed: succeeded
💾 Order updated with Stripe info: order_789
```

## 🚨 Next Steps

1. **Add Service Role Key** - Most critical for webhook processing
2. **Test Payment Flow** - Should now create database records
3. **Verify Webhook Processing** - Use Stripe CLI for local testing
4. **Monitor Console Logs** - Look for success/error messages

The core integration is correctly implemented - we just need to ensure proper authentication and environment setup for database writes.
